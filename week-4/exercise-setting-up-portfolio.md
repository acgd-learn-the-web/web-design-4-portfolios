## Overview

Start your portfolio on your chosen platform. Make sure the project is up and running & connect it to your purchased domain.

1. On your platform of choice make your portfolio project
2. Purchase your domain from a registrar (suggested: https://www.hover.com/)
3. Follow your hosting provider’s instructions for connecting the domain to your project

## Domain purchases

Ideally chose a domain registrar for your domain—do not purchase it through your hosting provider.

- https://www.hover.com/ <br>A solid, reliable, Canadian provider that’s able to delegate .ca domains. Good prices & no shady business practices.

### Choosing a domain

- `.ca` is highly suggested because it will give you better “Google Juice” for Canadian searches. (Though it does require you to be a Canadian citizen.)
- Try to avoid .com if you can for the a similar reason as above: it says “United States”. (Even though technically it doesn’t mean that.)
- Maybe try some of the fancy new domains like .design or .sexy. (Maybe not .sexy)
- Be aware of the price of the TLD you’re leasing—there’s a yearly cost.

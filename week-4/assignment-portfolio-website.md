## Overview

Create your full portfolio website, adding all the image & text content and finalize all the details so it’s the best possible.

- It should be completely responsive between 320px – ~2500px.
- Only real images and real text.
- The design, logos, typography, etc. should be complete.
- **Every single portfolio piece should be final.** <br>If they’re incomplete because you’re still working on them in another class put as much in as absolutely possible.
- Add in all the accessibility features we’ve discussed in the past. <br>Performance is a big deal—spend time compressing & exporting your graphics properly. But don’t put massive RAW graphics on your website. I don’t want to have to wait 10 minutes for it to download.
- There should be no broken links anywhere on the website.

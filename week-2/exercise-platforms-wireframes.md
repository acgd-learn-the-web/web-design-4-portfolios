## Overview

Choose the platform you want to use to create your portfolio website—or code it all yourself. Some of you may want to write the code by hand—and you’re encourage to do so.

After you’ve found your platform look through the available themes and select one that will work well for your portfolio. Use that theme’s capabilities as a starting point to design your pages.

1. Choose a platform (or code it yourself)
2. Choose a theme (or code it yourself)
3. Sketch out the homepage, based on the theme
4. Sketch out a case study page, based on the theme

## Platforms to consider

Choose your platform wisely—because you’re stuck with it. Look at the features. Look the the available themes. Look at the websites created with it. Look at the cost.

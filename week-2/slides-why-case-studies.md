# Why case studies?

There’s so much more to design than just the final outcome: thinking, research, sketches, revisions, etc. Potential employers want to see your process just as much as the final product.

## Client projects are best

Ideally build your portfolio fully with client projects & as few school projects as possible.

- Everybody here has exactly the same school projects
- The more client projects you have the more you distinguish yourself from your peers

---

## Case studies are engaging

The absolute best portfolio websites include 5–10 full, long case studies showing every facet of the created work.

## Case study components

Most good portfolio case studies a broken down into categories

- Goal & purpose
- Ideas & sketches
- Revisions & feedback
- Final version

_Use your creativity to present this information in a way that feels right for your personality._

## Goal & purpose

- What did the client want to achieve?
- How did you research the solution?
- How did you determine the project was a success?
- Personas, target audience

## Ideas & sketches

- Information architecture & organization
- Moodboards, style tiles, sample patterns
- Thumbnails, storyboards, iteration sketches

## Revisions & feedback

- Process going from early sketches to final version
- Included feedback and revisions
- Show the process, the different attemps
- Show failures & false starts

## Final version

- Make mockups for signs, shirts, banners, buses
- Link to actual video, website, app
- Make motion pieces showing of use cases
- Show details & closeups
- Show off everything!

_And denote why & how the project was successful._

## Include failures

**Show failed attempts & show negative feedback.**

It helps clients see you can accept critiques & find a way to improve what you’ve created.

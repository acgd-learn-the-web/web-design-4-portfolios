## Overview

We want to confirm everybody’s website works well in all browser situations—it’s easiest if we cooperate to get it all tested.

1. Add your website URL to the teachers master list
2. Get assigned a browser device by the teacher (or maybe an [accessibility tool](exercise-accessibility-testing.md), or a [performance test](exercise-performance-testing.md))
3. Using the master list of domains, that the teacher sent around, go through each website & check it in your assigned tool
4. If you find problems, let the person know what the problems are—and, if you know, how to fix the problem

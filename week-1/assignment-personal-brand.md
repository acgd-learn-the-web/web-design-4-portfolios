## Overview

Create the assets necessary to define your personal brand: your logo/wordmark, your colours, your visual palette, your own personal

_This is for your **personal** portfolio website—so the brand must represent you as an individual being._ **No company-oriented brands will be accepted.**

Some questions to consider when designing your brand:

- What’s your personality?
- What makes you different from all your peers?
- Why do you want to be a designer?
- Why do you get up every morning & want to work as a designer?
- What’s your perfect placement location?
- What does that company look for in designers?
- Why would you be a good asset for that company?
- How can you communicate your personality through visuals & text?
- The colours you chose, how do they communicate your personality?
- The type you chose, how does that distinguish you?
- The imagery you chose, how does that help employers understand you?

## Marking rubric

Below is the rubric of expectations for this project. **You will be assigned a percentage based on your standing within the rubric.**

|  | 0 points | 1 points | 2 points | 3 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Details** | No sweating | Some details sweat | Sweat all the details | Disgusting, dripping, sweaty details |
| **Personality & design** | Bland, boring, just another graphic designer | Fairly generic, visual design could be pushed more | Quality layouts and unique, personable content & design | Unique and recognizable as you, with engaging, personable content & design |
| **Logo** | Incomplete or missing | Only works well at one size | Small sizes are inconsistent with large sizes | Cohesive & uniform for all sizes, even if different |
| **Visual design** | Incomplete or missing | Missing important components or poorly executed | Average, could be more cohesive & considered | Cohesive & appropriate with a good sample of components |
| **Accessibility** | No considerations | Lots of accessibility problems | Just the basics: colour contrast | Accessibility is well considered for all design points |
| **Professionalism** | Rushed & poorly done | Okay | Average, could use more time spent | Clearly demonstrated lots of effort and consideration |

## Hand in

Create a document, a PDF would be best, showing your personal brand. Kind of like a moodboard, but more detailed.

- Show your logo & wordmark
- Show your type choices
- Show your colours & textures
- Show some component ideas: buttons, banners, etc.
- **And write a rationale explaining all the decisions**

Upload your brand document online for grading.

_The teacher will spend time with you in class to discuss your brand._

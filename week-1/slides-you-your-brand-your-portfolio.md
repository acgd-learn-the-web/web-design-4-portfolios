# You, your brand & your portfolio

Explain the process of creating your portfolio throughout the term, expectations, and requirements.

---

## The goal of this 7-week term is to make your portfolio website.

- Every assignment & exercise supports that goal

---

## You’re in control

- You define what you portfolio will be
- You grade your own portfolio with the rubrics
- You explain your choices to the teacher and rationalize why your portfolio is what it is

---

## Make it personal

- This is your **personal** website—you are not a company
- Nobody wants to hire a competing company for placement

---

## Have a goal

- You want to show off your capabilities
- The more focused your pieces the better
- Remain honest: if you’re not interested in motion work, don’t show motion pieces

_Even think about your dream job/company and target them directly!_

---

## Fewer & better

- 5–10 of your absolute best work
- Even just 3 absolutely stunning case studies

---

## Case studies are best

The absolute best portfolio websites include case studies for every showcased work. **Case studies are what employers are looking for.**

---

## Employers want to see:

- the purpose & goal of the project
- your different ideas & _sketches_
- your process & _sketches_
- the steps you took to get to the final version (& _sketches_)
- feedback and thoughts for the different stages
- and maybe the final version—but it’s less important

(As a by-product, you also can prove that you are capable of writing—an extremely important trait for a designer!)

---

## Improve your work

What you currently have for a portfolio piece is not the best it can be.

- If your teacher gave you feedback—fix it!
- If you would do something differently & better—do it!

_Your portfolio is a representation of your best work—so improve every piece._

---

## Always be working

_Every week you should be working on your portfolio—period_

---

## Start now!

Think about:

- your brand—fun? personal? corporate?
- what pieces to include?
- one page? many pages?
- how many pieces (~5–10)?
- everything!

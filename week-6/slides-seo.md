## Google search results layout

![](search-results.jpg)

Google uses information from your website in its search results listings in the following ways:

- The `<title>` of your page is the big blue link
- The `<meta>` description or text from the first <p> is the description under the link
- The page URLs are used to highlight keywords
- Google can pull out important pages and links from navigation or breadcrumbs
- Extra info like ratings, votes, times comes from your metadata

## Page title

**The title must be unique for every single page.**

- _Homepage title pattern:_ <br>“Site/Company Name · Small keyword rich, catchy phrase · City, Country”

- _Inside page title pattern:_ <br>“Page Title · Site/Company Name”

---

## Page description

**The page description must be unique for every single page and max 150 characters.**

- A short sentence describing the purpose and content of this individual page.
- Use appropriate keywords.
- Write real sentences for humans — keyword stuffing will be penalized.

## Social media

When you share something on Facebook or Twitter (et al.), the little preview is defined by specific tags.

_Each platform will have a different way to denote these tags._

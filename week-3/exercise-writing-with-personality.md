Write a short, 3–5 sentence, paragraph to be used as your bio that communicates why you want to be a designer & clearly shows your personality.

## Details

Because so much of the Open Web is based on text we can communicate a lot about ourselves through the text. Since the first interaction many people have with us is through our online portfolios we need to communicate our personality through the text.

### Your why

When writing about yourself for the Web you want the text to follow the standards we discussed at the start to the class—but you also what your text to have personality.

One way to help reach people and get people to understand your personality—which is really what you want for your portfolio—is to tell them why you’re a graphic designer not what you are as a graphic designer.

### Your personality

When writing to communicate a personality it’s fun to think of a personified animal and use their voice to write the words.

1. Pick a personified spirit animal that you think represents you
2. Write a personal bio using that animals voice—go overboard & really push if or this iteration (we can tone it down later.)

#### Things to think about when writing

- Think about word choices: formal vs. slang, specific descriptions
- Think about grammar: sentence length, punctuation
- Think about emotions & personality: rude, distracted, intense, etc.

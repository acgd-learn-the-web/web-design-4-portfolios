## Overview

Finalize what work you want on your website. You should have 5–10 of your absolute best pieces—you’re aiming for less pieces for higher quality. (Even just 3 absolutely stunning case studies would be good.)

- Figure out the pieces you want to include, even if they’re not done yet.
- Write a small description for each piece denoting this information:
  - Title of the work
  - Type of work (print, motion, web, etc.)
  - Why you’re including it—and how it shows your talent
  - Why your perfect work place would want to see this
- Find sketches, older versions, etc. for each piece—the best portfolios use case studies to show work, not just still images.
- If your teacher gave you feedback on the school project update it to your better skill level.
- Start writing out all the case-study content so you have a direction before you begin making your portfolio pages.

## Goal

The goal is to show off what you’re capable of doing as a graphic designer. The more focused your portfolio pieces the better.

Think about your perfect company & perfect job and only include work that will help you get that job! The more focused the better. If you want a job at Shopify, as an example, target your portfolio to exactly what Shopify is looking for.

Remain honest—if you have absolutely no interest in motion graphics, don’t show motion pieces.

### Case studies are best

The absolute best portfolio websites include case studies for every showcased work. Case studies are what employers want.

Employers want to see:

- the purpose & goal of the project
- your different ideas
- your process
- the steps you took to get to the final version
- feedback and thoughts for the different stages
- and maybe the final version—but it’s less important

(As a by-product, you also can prove that you are capable of writing—an extremely important trait for a designer.)

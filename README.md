# Web Design 4

Graphic designers are hired for their creativity and their work quality. The first interaction potential employers have is through the designer’s online presence—most importantly, a portfolio website. Personal domain leasing, email address and server configuration, content management systems, web design platforms and peer reviews are some of the topics explored to launch a successful personal portfolio website.

- Launch an online personal, interactive portfolio website to help support industry job search
- Organize and plan the content for large-scale case studies of graphic design work to be presented in a personal portfolio
- Follow industry best practices to optimize the performance and accessibility of an online portfolio website
